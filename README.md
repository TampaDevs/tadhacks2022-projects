### VDSIG

10:22 - 15:00

Our project is about voice digital signature. We want to reduce the waiting and authentication time. We provide a solution to get sensitive data from our users without having any access to those data, and pass those data to companies that the user allows us to do. We used blockchain technology to ensure our users that their privacy is met. We used asymmetric and symmetric encryption to achieve this goal.
